# LDKeepItAlive
Game Jam submission for Ludum Dare April 2020

All code was written by the team, however we used a [game engine of our own making](https://bitbucket.org/SimonRhys/injan/) which we have worked on outside of the jam.

All assets used are either of our own creation or ones available to use under the [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

Because we're nice we've included links to the assets we didn't make ourselves.
